# Valuing a Bitcoin Mining Asset

The objective of this project is to simulate the profits of a Bictoin mining asset for next year.

This includes the following work:
- Fit day-ahead and real-time prices distribution (find adapted distribution and parameters for it)
- Simulate DA and RT prices over the next year using Monte Carlo
- Simulate Bitcoin prices over the next year using Monte Carlo
- Define multiple mining strategies (wheter buying power in the DA or RT, deciding to mine or not)
- Estimating the asset profits, and therefore its value
- Explore node diversification
